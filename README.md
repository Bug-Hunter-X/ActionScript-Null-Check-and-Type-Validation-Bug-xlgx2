This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript bug involving null checks and type validation. The `bug.as` file showcases the buggy code, and `bugSolution.as` provides the corrected version.  The bug arises from using the loose equality operator (`==`) for null checks, which can lead to unexpected type coercion and bypass type validation.  The solution employs strict equality (`===`) for reliable null checks and explicit type checking using the `is` operator.
